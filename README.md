##Reddit Image Downloader
It's a simple reddit image downloader. You can select any subreddit as long as it exists and it's not empty. Any of these pages can be selected to download the pictures from: hot, new, rising, controversial, top or gilded. You can currently download up to 500 pictures and save them in the default directory (on Windows that is "C:\Users\Public\Pictures\" and on Linux it's the current working directory). Otherwise you can input a valid path yourself. The last option is whether you would like to save in the specific subreddit folder (e.g. pics/pic1.jpg, gameofthrones/pic33.jpg).
